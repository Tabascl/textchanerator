# textchanerator
Generate text with a TensorFlow LSTM network.

## Usage
Text is pulled from 4chan using the 4nbp notebook (naahh it isn't, fix that). This will get all posts from each thread of all boards, so this may take some time. Total data amount will be around 90MB.

Use api.py to train the model.
